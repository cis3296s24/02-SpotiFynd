# SpotiFynd Data CLI
A command-line interface (CLI) using Typer for a user’s Spotify statistics. Given a command, the program will send a Spotify Web API request using the Spotipy library, which will return the requested information (such as an artist’s top N tracks, the most popular tracks in the US right now, tempo of a song, etc.)

There are many Spotify command-line apps (For instance, Spotify-cli), but most have more of a focus on being an interface (playback, creating playlists, etc.) than a data tool. Rather than being an alternative frontend/UI to the Spotify desktop app, this application focuses more on quickly and easily accessing song data (which isn’t available in the desktop app).
